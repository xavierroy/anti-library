# My Anti-Library

This is my anti-library. This serves as a visual reminder of what I donâ€™t know.

This is opposed to my [read bookshelf](https://xavierroy.com/library) and the idea comes from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's description of the unique relationship my favourite writer Umberto Eco had with his books in Taleb's book The Black Swan (which is part of this anti-library).
